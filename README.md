# Coffee-shop-sales-dashboard
I developed a small project in Excel, creating dashboard and pivot tables to analyze the sales data for a coffee shop. The goal is to find insights that help improve business performance by looking at things like what people buy, when they buy it, and how busy the stores are. By cleaning organizing the data, I use Excel to understand trends like how sales vary across days, months, year.
## Problem statement:
Analyze sales records and build a Dashboard for a coffee shop using Excel. Identify trends, patterns, and insights that can inform strategic decision-making and enhance business performance. The objective is to explore various aspects of sales data, including product performance, peak sales periods, and revenue trends, to uncover actionable insights that can improve sales strategies.
## Recommended Analysis:
1. What is the total sales revenue for each month ?
2. What is the total sales revenue for each year ?
3. What is the total sales revenue by categories ?
4. What is the total sales revenue by city?
5. What is the total solds revenue by categories ?
6. What is the total Transaction by weekdays,Months, years ?
7. What is the total Profits by products ?
